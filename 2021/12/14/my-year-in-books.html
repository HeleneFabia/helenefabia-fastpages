<p>This year, for the first time, I set myself a reading challenge in Goodreads. I only started using Goodreads at the end of 2019 and used it throughout 2020 to track all the books I read and wanted to read. So based on the number of books I read in 2020 (it was 27), I challenged myself to 30 books. Given that in 2020 I had quite some slack and found a lot of time to read, I was curious whether with a full-time job this year, I would be able to reach my goal.</p>

<p>And I did! Already at the beginning of December I finished my 30th book. Alas, here it is: my year in books. I won’t include every book I read this year, though, but a selection of the most memorable ones.</p>

<h3 id="eating-animals-by-jonathan-safran-foer"><em>Eating Animals</em> by Jonathan Safran Foer</h3>

<p>Over the past few year, I have read widely and deeply into the topics of animal ethics, animal welfare and veganism. But oh my, if ever anyone is curious about besaid topics, I would undoubtedly recommend them this book. Foer does not want to convince you to go vegan - in fact, he is also on the fence about it. Which is why he wrote this book in the first place, to gain more clarity on where meat comes from, and how it affects animals, people, and the environment. He talks with meat plant workers, pig farmers and vegan activists, and shows how multi-facetted and complex the question of what we eat in fact is. What struck me the most about this book is how ruthless and honest he is in presenting the facts about factory farming. His descriptions of injured, ill and caged-up animals were horrifying and - although just words - almost as shocking and repulsive as seeing documentaries about it. The power of the images Foer creates with words makes the book a very compelling read and I think leaves every reader with a lot to think about.</p>

<h3 id="the-art-of-gathering-how-we-meet-and-why-it-matters-by-priya-parker"><em>The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters</em> by Priya Parker</h3>

<p>Having been an effective altruism community builder for two and a half years, I am fascinated by how to create engaging events, help a people in a group connect with each other on a personal level, and turn gatherings into memorable moments. The particular reason I read this book was that I was organizing this year’s EA retreat. Since this was my first multi-day event I ever organized and because of my desire to create a unique experience for member of the Austrian EA community to connect in person aftermany lockdowns and online-only events, I decided to learn more about event organizing. Except that this bookis not really about event organizing. It’s about creating a unique and bonding experience for people. I read this book primarily with the retreat I was going to organize in mind and took notes about anything I found relevant for it - I highly recommend reading the book with a specific purpose in mind like I did!</p>

<h3 id="the-anthropocene-reviewed-by-john-green"><em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em> by John Green</h3>

<p>As a teenager, I loved John Green’s books. I liked his writing style that made every character speak extraordinarily sophisticated (far too sophisticated than any of the characters might realistically speak), I liked how relatable his characters and how emotional his stories were. John Green’s newest book is not really targeted at teenagers anymore, and it’s also non-fiction. But it still has the same qualities, the same feeling I admired about his past books. <em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em> is an expedition through different facets of the us humans, what we created and what we destroyed. Each chapter illuminates a very particular - and often quite absurd - aspect about humanity (be it hot-dog eating contests, ancient cave paintings or Monopoly) and ties it in with one of John Green’s personal memories and greater, more general insights about what defines the human race. Each chapter is exquisitely told and lets you marvel about the beauty of the world - or share John Green’s hope that humanity can in fact still very much improve in many aspects.</p>
