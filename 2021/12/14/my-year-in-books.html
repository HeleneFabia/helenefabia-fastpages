<p>This year, for the first time, I set myself a reading challenge in Goodreads. I only started using Goodreads at the end of 2019 and used it throughout 2020 to track all the books I read and wanted to read. So based on the number of books I read in 2020 (it was 27), I challenged myself to 30 books. Given that in 2020 I had quite some slack and found a lot of time to read, I was curious whether with a full-time job this year, I would be able to reach my goal.</p>

<p>And I did! Already at the beginning of December I finished my 30th book. Alas, here it is: my year in books. I won’t include every book I read this year, though, but a selection of the most memorable ones.</p>
