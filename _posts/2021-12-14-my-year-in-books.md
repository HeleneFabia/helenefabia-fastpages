title: My year in books - 2021
description: A short review of the most memorable books I've read this year.
---

This year, for the first time, I set myself a reading challenge in Goodreads. I only started using Goodreads at the end of 2019 and used it throughout 2020 to track all the books I read and wanted to read. So based on the number of books I read in 2020 (it was 27), I challenged myself to 30 books. Given that in 2020 I had quite some slack and found a lot of time to read, I was curious whether with a full-time job this year, I would be able to reach my goal.

And I did! Already at the beginning of December I finished my 30th book. Alas, here it is: my year in books. I won't include every book I read this year, though, but a selection of the most memorable ones.

## Non-Fiction

### *Eating Animals* by Jonathan Safran Foer

Over the past few year, I have read widely and deeply into the topics of animal ethics, animal welfare and veganism. But oh my, if ever anyone is curious about besaid topics, I would undoubtedly recommend them this book. 
Foer does not want to convince you to go vegan - in fact, he is also on the fence about it. Which is why he wrote this book in the first place, to gain more clarity on where meat comes from, and how it affects animals, people, and the environment. He talks with meat plant workers, pig farmers and vegan activists, and shows how multi-facetted and complex the question of what we eat in fact is.  
What struck me the most about this book is how ruthless and honest he is in presenting the facts about factory farming. His descriptions of injured, ill and caged-up animals were horrifying and - although just words - almost as shocking and repulsive as seeing documentaries about it.
